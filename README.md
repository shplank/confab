# confab

A chat app for mobile devices built using React Native and Gifted Chat. Expo and Android Studio were used in the development process.

## Required libraries:

- React Native
- React Navigator
- Gifted Chat
- Firebase
- Asynch Storage
- NetInfo

## For development:

- Expo
- Android Studio

## To set up app:

Enter the following in your command terminal:

```console
git clone https://github.com/shplank/confab.git
cd confab/
npm install
```

## Install Expo

You can check out the React Native [website](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for more detailed instructions. Below is a simplified version.

In your command terminal (I recommend the terminal built into VS Code), type the following:

```console
npm install expo-cli --global
```

Also download the Expo app on your smartphone.

## Simulator/Emulator

To set up the iOS simulator, you need XCode on your Mac (not available for Windows). It’s available to download from the App Store. After installing XCode, open it up and head over to Preferences. From there, click Components and install a simulator from the list. Open the simulator, start your Expo project, and click Run on iOS simulator.

If you are using Windows 10, you can set up Android Emulator. To do so, you first need to download and install Android Studio. To do this, follow the on-screen installation instructions and make sure you don’t untick the Android Virtual Device option in the installation dialog. Consult this [page](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) for more information on how to set up your Android Emulator. I recommend choosing a device that uses Google Play.
